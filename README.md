## Setting up GitHub Actions for KHarish15/testing7 Python Project

This document outlines the steps to integrate GitHub Actions for the KHarish15/testing7 Python project.

**1. Adding the Workflow File:**

Create a file named `.github/workflows/test.yml` in your repository. This file will contain the GitHub Actions configuration.

```yaml
name: Python tests

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.9, 3.10]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install pytest
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          pytest test_main.py
```

**2. Required Environment Variables:**

None are needed for this project.

**3. Dependencies:**

The project requires `pytest` for testing.

**4. Configuring the Test Framework:**

Ensure your test files are named `test_main.py`. This is crucial for `pytest` to discover tests automatically.

**5. Viewing Test Results:**

GitHub Actions will display test results directly in the workflow run.  A successful run will show a green checkmark.  A failed run will show details of the failed test cases.  Clicking on the run will show the full output, including test output and logs.

**6. Troubleshooting Common Issues:**

* **`ModuleNotFoundError`:**  Ensure `pytest` is correctly installed using `pip install pytest`. Double-check the `test_main.py` file's path and import statements to make sure they point to the correct locations.


* **`ImportError`:** Verify the `main.py` file is in the same directory as `test_main.py`.  Incorrect relative imports can lead to this error.


* **Tests failing:** Carefully review the test output for specific errors.  Are assertions failing?  Is there an error in `main.py` that's causing the test failures?

**7. Project-Specific Configuration Steps (None in this case):**

The provided code and tests are simple enough that no further configuration is required.

**Additional Notes:**

* **Structure:** While the structure is implicit, you should keep `main.py` and `test_main.py` in the same directory for the provided structure to work.  Following a consistent folder structure (like `src/` and `tests/`) for your project in the long term would be highly recommended.


* **Version Control:** Ensure that your `.github/workflows/test.yml` file is tracked in your Git repository.


* **Error Handling:** The `main.py` code has error handling, but you might want to strengthen testing coverage of those error cases.


* **Code style:** Consider incorporating a code style checker (e.g., `flake8`) into your workflow to ensure consistent coding practices.


* **Coverage:** For larger projects, consider adding code coverage reporting using tools like `pytest-cov`.


This detailed setup ensures your Python project is ready for continuous integration and testing using GitHub Actions. Remember to commit and push the changes to your repository to trigger the workflow.

## Generated Files

- `.github/workflows/test.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow
- `tests/` - Test files
- This README - Setup instructions

## How to Use

1. Push code to trigger automated tests
2. View results in the Actions tab
3. Tests run on every push and pull request

## Token Information

- Generated by: KHarish15
- Repository: KHarish15/testing7
- Generated on: 2025-08-01 07:27:54

## Security Note

The GitHub token used for this setup should have the minimum required permissions:
- `repo` scope for private repositories
- `public_repo` scope for public repositories
- Write access to the repository

For security, consider using GitHub Apps or fine-grained personal access tokens.
