# Automated Testing Setup

This repository has been automatically configured with GitHub Actions for continuous testing.

## Setup Instructions

# Setup Instructions for KHarish15/testing7

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- Git configured with your GitHub credentials

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KHarish15/testing7.git
cd KHarish15/testing7
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm init -y
npm install playwright
npx playwright install --with-deps
```

### 3. Set Up Local Development Server
For HTML testing, you'll need a local server:
```bash
# Using Python (if available)
python -m http.server 3000

# Or using Node.js
npx serve . -p 3000
```

### 4. Configure Playwright
The `playwright.config.js` file has been created with basic configuration.

### 5. Run Tests Locally
```bash
npx playwright test
```

## GitHub Actions
The workflow file has been added to `.github/workflows/test.yml`
Tests will run automatically on push and pull requests.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed
- Check that Playwright browsers are installed: `npx playwright install`
- Verify the local server is running on port 3000
- Check browser compatibility if tests fail

## HTML-Specific Considerations
- Tests validate HTML structure and content
- Cross-browser testing is included
- HTML validation is performed automatically
- Screenshots are captured on test failures
